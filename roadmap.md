# Roadmap

Skippy just got started: The current focus is to apply it to large real-life projects to iron out any teething 
problems. The next items on the roadmap are

- support for JUnit 4,
- distribution of plugins via Gradle Plugin Portal,
- support for Maven-based builds,
- accurate JaCoCo coverage data despite skipped test to support CI pipelines with strict code coverage requirements
- support for incremental analysis updates,
- support for reasoning based on changes in the classpath (e.g., a version bump in `build.gradle`),
- support for reasoning based on updated resources (e.g, an updated setting in `src/main/resource/application.properties`) and.
- support for other JVM-based languages.
