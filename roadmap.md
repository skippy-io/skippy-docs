# Roadmap

Skippy just got started: The current focus is to apply it to large real-life projects to iron out any teething 
problems. The next items on the roadmap:

- Support for JUnit 4
- Support for Maven-based builds
- Accurate JaCoCo coverage data despite skipped test to support CI pipelines with strict code coverage requirements
- Support for incremental analysis updates
- Support for reasoning based on changes in the classpath (e.g., a version bump in `build.gradle`)
- Support for reasoning based on updated resources (e.g, an updated setting in `src/main/resource/application.properties`)
- Support for other JVM-based languages
