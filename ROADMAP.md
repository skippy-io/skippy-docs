# Roadmap

Skippy just got started: The current focus is to apply it to large real-life projects to iron out any teething 
problems. The next items on the roadmap are

- proper logging,
- support for JUnit 4,
- support for incremental analysis updates,
- support for reasoning based on changes in the classpath (e.g., a version bump in `build.gradle`)
- support for reasoning based on updated resources (e.g, an updated setting in `src/main/resource/application.properties`),
- distribution via Maven Central,
- distribution via Gradle Plugin Portal,
- skipped tests contributing to JaCoCo reports and execution data files,
- support for Maven-based builds and
- support for other JVM-based languages.
